# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Repo

I will use this repository to gather some of my ML &amp; DL codes together. They will contain some instances from the tutorials I wathced, and applications of different approaches implemented by me.
Later me, or you, or anyone can use those as a cheatsheet.

Feel free to use & enjoy!

Also feel free to contact me for anything: mehmetcesitli@gmail.com
